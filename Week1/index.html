    <h2>Task 1: My task 1</h2>
 <p>
        My chosen topic is <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i> or <i>Le Carnaval des animaux</i> by Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. 
        I have chosen this work as the theme for my dataset because it is one of my favourite musical suites. As the work is made up of many short but varied pieces, 
        there is a lot for me to talk about and analyse. My favourite piece from <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i> is The Elephant. The work should be easy to access as,
        due to its fame, there are many versions of it available online. 
     </p>

        Online libraries, such as IMSLP, can provide musical scores, meta data and both comercial and synthesized/MIDI recordings. This availability of information will help my 
        research for this dataset. IMSLP in particular offers musical scores for the whole work and also for the individual works. Hopefully this will make it easier for me to
        complete tasks in the coming weeks, as I won't have to cut down full orchestral scores.
