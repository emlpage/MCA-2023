		<p>For Week 9's task, we were asked to identify 3 tracks related to out portfolio theme and present a Spectrogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, and a Chromagram alongside the orignal waveform. 
		For the purposes of this weeks task, I will reuse the tracks I analysed in Week 8.</p><br>

      <h3>Analysis</h3><br>
      
      <p>As someone that doesn't come from a music theory based background, I found that the histograms were helpful at figuring out significant differences between the tracks. For example,
      as all 3 are dance songs - a genre largely defined by melody and drums, I found prior to the task that there would be similarities. However, I decided to pick 3 tracks from 
      different subgenres of dance music. "Duvet" being a techno / trance track with a big melody and standard drums, where as "Tremor" has more of industrial influence with big drum parts. "Party Like a Rockstar" comes from Hardstyle
      where the melody is big as well as having a loud bassy kick. <br>
      <br>
      For this task, I've decided to analyse the MFCC Histograms. As all 3 tracks are from a similar genre, I expect to find some similarities in sound and frequency. As Duvet and Tremor were 
      originally produced by the same artists - Virtual Self, some of the features are very alike, such as the synth sounds. The MFCC graphs reflect that, being that they are similar in frequency - albeit, Tremor is a little more noise heavy
      due to the intensity of the track. As Party Like A Rockstar is very kick heavy, where most of the "peak" sounds would come from, I would expect that the sound would be a sharp drop, which the histograms above reflect.</p>
