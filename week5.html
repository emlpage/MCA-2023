        <h2>MEI tasks week 5/7</h2>
        <p>
           I tried to get these tasks to work, but was unsuccessful. Please find two screenshots of
           the MEI Friend page. I have also typed out my code from these tasks and attached that as an image.
           <br>
           I struggled with these tasks particularly as I have never had to write code before and
           have struggled with fixing errors. While these tasks are not completed, a great deal of
           effort went into my attrmpt.
