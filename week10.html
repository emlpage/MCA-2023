		<h2>Task 1 - Generating an Audio Similarity Matrix <h2><br>
    		<p>See below, a matrix- left- and a plot graph- right. Tracks 0-3 are classical in genre, tracks 4-6 are rock in genre, and 
            the last tracks 7-9 are represented as country. However, these last country pieces have been swapped out for 
            my tracks: The Elephant, Kangaroos, and Wild Asses.  <br>
		<br>
		<p>My three pieces are definitely most similar to the classical tracks 0-3 on the matrix, which is to be expected.
            Although, I did think they would be slightly more similar.
            <br>
            On the plot graph my three pieces, once again, are much more similar to the other classical tracks than the rock
            tracks- again, to be expected. However, I am not confident in how reliable this plot graph is as it only tracks the 
            occurence of A and C notes. The Elephant is in the key of Eb, which features far fewer As and Cs than a Transcription
            a tone higher in F.

      <h3>The automatic transcription is very obviously different to the original. The original piece is in Eb major, however the 
        recreation is in A major. The original piece is in 3/8 and the recreation is in 4/4. The timbre was simplified from wind
        octet to solo piano. Partially because of this, the notes, both in pitch and rhythm are not at all similar- although it 
        must be said that there is still a very faint feeling of the original melody. It is almost like the tenth variation of a 
        piece, after the artist loses inspiration and just throws notes. 
        <br>
        I would not recommend automatic transcription as a tool for curation and analytics.
