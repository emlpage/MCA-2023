        <h2>Task 1: Theme for my Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The theme that I have chosen for my dataset is The Carnival of the Animals, composed by 
            Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. The Carnival of the Animals is a classical work of short comedic pieces,
            composed in 1886. I have chosen this for my dataset as Specifically as its age, fame and
            popularity mean there is a lot of data already available. Examples of musical scores and 
            audio recordings- both live and digital- are easy to find. There are also lots of reliable
            sources for metadata. Furthermore, the variety of short, pieces mean I have plenty of choice
            for analysis- and they are all managable sized files. I will be focusing on the piece 
            The Elephant as it is my favourite.
