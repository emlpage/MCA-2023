                Some of the changes needed:
                <ul>
                    <li>Instrumentation added- all parts were written as voice, 
                        this meant transposition was required for some instrumentation</li>
                    <li>Time signature corrected- while it found the correct 3/8 time signature,
                        MuseScore was unable to format the rests which pushed all notation out of sync</li>
                    <li>Smaller details such as articulation. In bar 20 of the lowest voice/instrument, 
                        Musescore added a pedal marking, despite it being irrelivant to both voice and 
                        wind octet.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
           </p>
